# Assembly of ECG and BioZ Brick

## Soldering

### 3.5mm Connector
Firmly press the 3.5mm connector into the holes and solder all three pins.

### Wires
Attach color coded wires to the IO pads. E.g. red for power, black or green for ground and blue or white for digital input/output.

You can insert the wires into the holes (perpendicular) or or you can attach a short piece of the wires on top of the pad (perpendicular).

Suggested connecctions for the Sparkfun Thing Plus (USB-C) and the Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 are below:

PAD       | Function                  | Thing Plus  | Feather
---       |---                        |---          |---
**VCC**   | Power                     | 3V3         | 3V3 
**GND**   | Power                     | GND         | GND
**CS0**   | Chip Select               | 08   GPIO15 | 6
**SDI***  | Master Out Slave In       | PICO GPIO23 | MO
**SDO***  | Master In Salve Out       | POCI GPIO19 | MI
**SCL**   | Serial Clock              | SCK  GPIO18 | SCK
**INTB**  | Interrupt Output          | 12   GIPO12 | 12 GPIO12
INT2B     | Interrupt 2 Output        | 11   GIPO27 | 13 GPIO13

Pin 10 (Feather, Thing Plus)  is reserved for system button.
Require connections are in **bold**.

*The MAX30001G Aanalog Front End uses the MOSI and MISO on diagrams showing a microcontroller. POCI and PICO should be used for "peripheral out controller in" and "perpherial in controller out".

## Board Configuration

There are many configurations we can select. We can operate the board to measure ECG or Impedance or both. We can operate the board to use only two leads, four leads or six leads. We can configure the board to measure impedance of a calibration resistor that is soldered onto the board (100 Ohm).

### Jumpers

![Jumpers](./Design.svg)

There are 4 sets of jumper:

1) The following jumpers are available to reduce the numnber of required leads. They create direct conenction between the pins of the plug and the chip IO:

    For single plug operation ECG&BioZ
    - $ECG_N$ to $BI_N$
    - $ECG_P$ to $BI_P$

    For single plug BioZ operation
    - $DRV_N$ to $BI_N$
    - $DRV_P$ to $BI_P$

2) The unbalance filters for Input and Offset can be bypassed. Those are the two input pins for ECG, Bioimedance and VCM :

    - $VCM_{UB}$: $VCM$ unbalance bypass
    - $EN_{UB}$: $ECG_N$ unbalance bypass
    - $EP_{UB}$: $ECG_P$ unbalance bypass

3) We can also disable input:

    - $ECG_P$ to $ECG_N$ (this shorts N and P terminal together, for BIOZ measurements only operation)
    - $BI_P$ to $BI_N$ (this shorts N and P terminal together, for ECG measurements only operation)

4) We can calibrate BIOZ with a 100 Ohm resistor:

    - $R_N$, $R_P$ connect $BI_N$, $BI_P$ to 100 Ohm (R18), for testing purose only, once conencted no external impedance can be measured.

If $V_{CM}$ is used for ECG right leg bias, internal lead bias needs to be disabled. Resistor can be 10k..200kOhm.

For specific hardware configuration setup the following jumpers should be set:

(X) = solder jumper closed

(*) Might need to replace R23 with 200kOhm and enable VCM bypass by soldering the jumper close.
