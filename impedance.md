# Tissue Impedance
## General
- [IEEE Tutorial](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9529213)
- [Instructables for DIY](https://www.instructables.com/Determining-Body-Composition-using-Arduino)

Instructable solution was implemented and worked. OPAmps were changed to work with 3.3V.
First OpAmp is a buffer. Second is a current to voltage converter, thrid OpAmp is differntial amplifier and 4th OpAmp is buffer.
