## Introduction

To complete their education, biomedical engineering undergraduate studentsrs must measure and iterpret data from living systems[1]. One approach to achive this learning goal, is to record data from normal volunteers in a classroom setting. Equipment is needed that can safely record common physiological signals. While there are commercial systems available [2] [3], there is no approach that uses an open hardware design and gives the option to expand functionality at later time. For a wide adoption, such equipment should be cost-effective. We present an example solution that can be produced in most academic settings using commonly available electronic and addititive manufacuting techniques. An advantage of such a solution is that its data recording and computing componentts support programming courses and the measurement modules can also serve academic research projects.

## Material and Methods

The design requirements of our system are that it
- measures several common physiological signals
- can be easily reproduced at an educational institution
- records, displays and stores measurements safely in a class room setting
