The ECG sender code is based in Arduino (C++). This code can be used to run the Sparkfun AD8232 ECG Pre-amplifier code. This code also has a digital low-pass filter to remove some of the noise from the ECG reading. Lastly, each of the sensors has an OLED screen and a button. This code already takes this into account. 
The OLED can switch display between the ECG reading and the battery percentage and discharge rate. Readings from the ECG is in millivolts. For the battery percentage and discharge rate, a library from the battery management is added in the code.
The button is used to switch said OLED display. This button can also be used to put the ESP32 into deep sleep. Pressing the button for one second switches the display, and holding it for 5 seconds puts the ESP32 into deep sleep mode.
