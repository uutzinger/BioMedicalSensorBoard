This is a description for ECG Sensor. See [Module Casing](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/Housing%20Models/Module%20Casing) for the entire casing design.


The ECG Module takes advantage of the Sparkfun ECG Pre-Amplifier Board. It uses the AD8232 IC to detect the voltage potential of the heart.
