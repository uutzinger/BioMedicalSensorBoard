This is the insert for the Sound Sensor Casing. See [Module Casing](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/Housing%20Models/Module%20Casing) for the entire casing design.

This insert is design to fit the [Plug](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/Sound%20Sensor/Plug%20for%20Stethoscope) that connects an electret microphone with a stethoscope tube.
